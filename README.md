# TheMusicMachine
TheMusicMachine is a cool thing I made one Friday

If you wanna see an example, check out Pianode (also on GitHub)

TheMusicMachine is very simple and was built for use with Pianode. You can use it for whatever you want and can modify it as well

Anyway, TheMusicMachine takes a letter that you send in and plays a sound based off of that letter.

##How to use
1. Download zip and open VS project
2. Build it
3. Stick it somewhere (C:/ drive?)
4. Write some C# code
```
using System.Diagnostics

public static void main(String[] args)
{
Process.Start("path/to/themusicmachine.exe", "letter");
}
```
5. Be amazed
